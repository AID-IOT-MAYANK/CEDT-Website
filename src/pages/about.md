# About Us

The Centre for Electronics Design and Technology is a design centre visioned by Dr. B.N. Mishra, founder director NSIT, and brought to reality by Dhananjay V. Gadre. Since its inception, CEDT has been a place where students from all majors have tinkered and innovated during their stay at NSIT. One can do almost anything at CEDT, during any time of the day and any day of the year!

This is an open access lab, where the students work on interesting projects and mentor others, helping in spreading the “Maker Keeda“.

## About Dhananjay V. Gadre

Greetings! I am Dhananjay V. Gadre, a passionate educator and Associate Professor at the Netaji Subhas University of Technology (formerly Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology) in New Delhi, India. My journey in academia spans over 30 years, marked by a commitment to fostering hands-on learning and innovation.

### Academic Background

I hold a Master of Engineering in Computer Engineering from the University of Idaho, USA, and a Master of Science in Electronic Science from the University of Delhi. My diverse academic experiences have shaped my approach to teaching and research.

### Contribution to Education

At NSUT, I have made significant contributions by establishing two open access laboratories – the Centre for Electronics Design and Technology (CEDT) and the Texas Instruments Centre for Embedded Product Design (TI-CEPD). CEDT, initiated under my guidance in 2003, has trained over 5000 students in hands-on electronics and system design. TI-CEPD, a result of an MOU between Texas Instruments India and NSIT in 2012, has been a hub for organizing internship workshops on Embedded System Design, benefitting over 500 participants.

### Professional Achievements

Throughout my career, I have not only imparted knowledge within the classroom but also extended my expertise globally. I have lectured and demonstrated my work across India and five continents, including at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland.

I am the proud author of several professional articles and six books. Notably, my book "TinyAVR Microcontroller Projects for the Evil Genius" has gained international recognition, being translated into Chinese and Russian. My latest work on TIVA ARM Cortex M4 microcontrollers, published by Springer Nature, reflects my ongoing commitment to advancing the field.

### Beyond Academia

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am a licensed radio amateur with a call sign VU2NOX since 1986. Looking ahead, I aspire to design, build, and launch an amateur radio satellite in the near future.
