# Contribute to CEDT Website

Welcome to the CEDT Website repository! We appreciate your interest in contributing to our project. Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or improving documentation, your contributions are highly valued.

## Getting Started

To get started with contributing to the CEDT Website, you'll need to go through the following steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need:
Before you dive into contributing to our Docusaurus-based blog repository, please ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Familiarity with Git:**

   - You should have a good understanding of Git, including cloning repositories, creating branches, committing changes, and pushing to remote repositories.

2. **Node.js:**

   - Ensure that you have Node.js installed. If not, you can download and install it from [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

3. **Text Editor:**

   - Choose a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) of your preference. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom.

4. **GitHub Account:**

   - You'll need a GitHub account to fork the repository, create branches, and submit pull requests. If you don't have one, you can sign up at [GitHub](https://github.com/).

5. **Docusaurus Understanding:**

   - Familiarize yourself with Docusaurus by exploring the [official documentation](https://v2.docusaurus.io/). Understand the structure of the blog, how markdown files are used, and the basic configuration.

6. **Markdown Knowledge:**

   - Since our blog content is written in markdown, a basic understanding of markdown syntax is essential. If you're new to markdown, you can refer to the [GitHub Guide on Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

7. **Node Package Manager (NPM):**

   - Although Yarn is our preferred package manager, being familiar with NPM (Node Package Manager) is beneficial, as some contributors might use it.

8. **Continuous Integration (CI) Awareness:**

   - Understand the basics of Continuous Integration, as our repository may use CI workflows. Familiarity with services like GitHub Actions is a plus.

9. **Community Etiquette:**
   - Review our code of conduct and community guidelines. Respectful and inclusive communication is vital for a collaborative and welcoming environment.
